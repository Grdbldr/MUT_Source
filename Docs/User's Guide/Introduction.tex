This document describes a Modflow interface called Modflow User Tools (MUT), which uses a
text-based approach to build a modflow project.  It currently relies on Tecplot\copyright, a third-party visualization software package,
to provide a 3D graphical interface for viewing the project mesh and properties during construction and then later for visualizing model results. In future, other visualization packages, including the open source program Paraview, could be supported and used instead.

The targeted version of Modflow is Modflow-USG (UnStructured Grid), which includes a new package that adds fully-coupled 2D surface water flow in a manner similar to the Connected Linear Network (CLN) package.

MUT can also post-process a Modflow-USG simulation to provide a Tecplot visualization.  If applied to older projects, which were constructed using earlier versions of Modflow, results may be mixed.  It is not our intent here to support all existing Modflow packages, many of which have been superceded by more modern ones.
