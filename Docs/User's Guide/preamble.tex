This document describes a Modflow interface called Modflow User Tools (MUT), which uses a
text-based approach to build a modflow project.  It currently relies on Tecplot\copyright, a third-party visualization software package,
to provide a 3D graphical interface for viewing the project mesh and properties during construction and then later for visualizing model results. In future, other visualization packages, including the open source program Paraview, could be supported and used instead.

The targeted version of Modflow is Modflow-USG (UnStructured Grid), which includes a new package that adds fully-coupled 2D surface water flow in a manner similar to the Connected Linear Network (CLN) package. 

As well as building new projects, MUT may be used to post-process existing Modflow projects which were constructed using earlier versions such as Modflow 2005.
