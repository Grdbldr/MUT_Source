\label{tex:InputFile}
\mut\ recognizes files which have the extension \verb+.mut+ as input files and reads and interprets them to produce both \mfus\ output files and \tecplot\ input files. Input files are ordinary text files which contain comments, \mut\ instructions and data which can be numbers or alphanumeric strings.

Comments begin with an exclamtion point character \verb+!+ and are ignored by \mut.  \mut\ initially strips the input file of all comments and creates a clean copy called \textit{prefix}\verb+o.input+, which is then processed by \mut.  This means comments can be placed anywhere in the input file.
