\label{tex:InputFile}
\mut\ recognizes files which have the extension \verb+.mut+ as input files and reads and interprets them to produce both \mfus\ output files and \tecplot\ input files. 

Comments begin with an exclamation point character \verb+!+ and are ignored by \mut.  \mut\ initially strips the input file of all comments and creates a clean copy called \textit{prefix}\verb+o.input+, which is then processed by \mut.  This means comments can be placed anywhere in the input file.
