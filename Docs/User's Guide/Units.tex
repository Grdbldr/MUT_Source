\label{section:Units}
The input files written by \mut\ define the units of length and time that are applied during the \mfus\ model simulation.

By default, \mut\ assigns meters as the units of length and seconds as the units of time. If desired, the following instructions can be used to define a different unit system:

\ins{units of length}
    {
        \squish
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item \str{LengthUnits}  The desired units of length.
        \end{enumerate}
        \mfus\ currently supports length units of feet, meters or centimeters.
        }

\ins{units of time}
    {
        \squish
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item \str{TimeUnits}  The desired units of time.
        \end{enumerate}
        \mfus\ currently supports time units of seconds, minutes, hours, days or years.
    }

These instructions would define units of centimeters and days instead of meters and seconds:
 \begin{verbatim}
    units of length
    centimeters

    units of time
    days
 \end{verbatim}

\mut\ converts the string variables \str{LengthUnits} and \str{StringUnits} to their numeric equivalents and passes that to \mfus\ through the variables \textsf{LENUNI} and \textsf{ITMUNI} respectively.
